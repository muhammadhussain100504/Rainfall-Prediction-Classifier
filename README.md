# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This repository contains an **end-to-end machine learning project** focused on predicting rainfall using real-world weather data.  
The project was completed as a **final project** as part of the **IBM Skills Network Machine Learning program**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate rainfall prediction is an important real-world problem with applications in agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.  
In this project, I built a **classification model** that predicts whether rainfall will occur based on historical weather features.

The notebook follows a structured machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation and optimization.
